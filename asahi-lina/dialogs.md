# About ruin machines

Ruin machines were built on centuries old technologies!! For example, there are numerous of attack vectors on the protocol and implementation level of the machines' embedded controllers~!! With the help of many buffer overflow and null pointer dereference exploits, we were able to trigger segmentation fault on them and have the machine completely shuts down! Not only that!!! But we were also able to exploit a remote code execution vulnerability and escalated all the privileges all the way to that we could even commit arbitrary code execution on the kernel level with the help of many novel architectural hardware exploits! With that, we were able to took full control of them! A novel kid from the Akademiya even managed to make a Ruin Guard sing and dance around children's songs!

Oh, are these languages too hard to understand for you..? Sorry~!! 
## About the Tyrant's Last Fury
Now that I think about it, does that incident feels like a, superbuffed version of a Field Tiller?
